# algorithms learned so far

In this post, I will be sharing some of the important algorithms that are easy to learn and very useful for implementing solutions in daily life. 
As I continue to explore deeper into the subject, my goal is to document the entire learning process, including basic examples.
You'll notice that I always try to apply these algorithms in my projects. This helps me address a variety of problems I encounter and put my learning into practice.
